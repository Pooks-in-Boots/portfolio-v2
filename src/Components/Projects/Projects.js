                    Throughout my time as a web developer, I have created several sites, and applications.
                    I've used many different languages, frameworks, and technologies.
                    My goal with these sites, is to learn from others work, and create new and innovative solutions to simple problems.
                    I have done several projects as a learning experience.
                    These experiences are used to practice the concept behind these technologies and allow me to fully understand the depth and uses of them.
                    <br />
                    I've included several projects, included with links and breif descriptions of their functionality.
